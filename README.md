# RustyChat

RustyChat is a simple, real-time chat application built with **Rust** using the **socketioxide** library for WebSocket communication. It allows users to join rooms, send messages, and receive real-time updates.

## Features

- **Room-based chat**: Users can join specific rooms and chat with others in that room.
- **Real-time messaging**: Messages are sent and received instantly without needing to refresh the page.
- **Persistent messages**: The chat stores the latest messages in memory and sends them when users join a room.
